		<p style="color: white; font-size: 150px">  Who We Be.
Well we be ballas, shot callas, 
no blades on our impalas,
hungry fellas, slighlty zealous,
living lives of eternal questioning.
Set our hearts to the wrestling,
till the day we rest in it,
Is this our destiny,
or somebody messin with it.

We be creators, innovators, modern-day Darth Vaders
manipulating the force, never to coerce, but to unhorse
the ignorers from the thrones
in which they reside,
Do not hide, 
Stand and sing,
bring the swing,
So when you lay for good,
the world may be a little more understood.
